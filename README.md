Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/obulisainaren/multi-cancer/data 

Our group project focuses on predicting cancer status based on images. We collected the data from Obuli Sai Naren's Multi Cancer Dataset on Kaggle. The model will use image processing tools like OpenCV to classify the data. To visualize our model's results, we will use bar graphs ROC curves to display accuracy metrics. To test our model, we will evaluate it on unseen data representative of the US population with cancer.
